# Commuter

This is a silly little command line app written in javascript (node) that tells you the time between two addresses. It uses the google maps api to get this information.

I built this for a few reasons:

1. My commute fucking sucks.
2. I often check on the time the commute will take because I like to know when my commute is going to fucking suck.
3. I wanted to play with node and npm. Both are fun, by the way.

## Installation

chmod +x ./lib/commuter/commuter.js

## Usage

./lib/commuter/commuter.js --start 'street, city, state, zip' --dest 'street, city, state, zip'
